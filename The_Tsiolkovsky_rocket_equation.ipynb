        "The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation is an ideal rocket equation which has the direct relation between change in velocity ($\\Delta v$), exhaust gases velocity ($v_0$), wet mass of the rocket ($m_0$), i.e. weight of the rocket at the time of take off including the weight of the fuel and dry mass of the rocket ($m_f$), i.e. when rocket has burnt all the fuel.\n",

        "\n",
        "This problem optimizes the design of a simple rocket for profit. Potential revenue increases with greater change in velocity, as greater velocities allow the payload to reach higher orbits that have less drag, allowing it to remain in orbit longer. Wet mass, dry mass, and exhaust velocity are design variables, where wet mass is the total initial mass of the rocket, including propellant, and dry mass is the mass of the rocket at full ascent.\n",
